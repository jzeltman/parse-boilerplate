# Parse JavaScript API/SDK Boilerplate
This is a simple, and hopefully growing, boilerplate for the Parse JavaScript API/SDK. If you are new to the SDK, it is essentially a fork of Backbone.js, with some modifications and some additions.

## Version 0.1
- Basic setup for starting a Parse app, just drop in your keys and you are ready to get started
- Functional Login Modal with Login and Signup methods built into the View
- Toggle dropdown Menu
